# Sample Tests Todo List

## Test Categories
1. AOE Test (tests/samples/aoe)
   - Status: Fixed
   - Test Command: `cd c:/PS/scripts/ps-simc-parser && pytest tests/samples/aoe/test_aoe.py -v`
   - Test Description: Tests AOE rotation generation with enemy counting logic
   - Test Files:
     - rotation.simc: Contains AOE rotation definition
     - expected.lua: Expected Lua output
     - test_aoe.py: Test implementation
   - Errors: 
     1. Initial Error: Test path not found when running from wrong directory
        - Fix: Updated command to run from project root directory
        - Status: Fixed
     2. Current Error: GeneratorError: Failed to generate action lists: 'spell'
        - Root Cause: Mismatch between parser output and generator expectations
        - Details:
          1. In generator.py, _generate_spell_cast expects action['spell']
          2. Parser is providing the spell name directly in action['name']
          3. This causes KeyError when trying to access action['spell']
        - Fix Being Applied:
          - Modified _generate_spell_cast to check both 'spell' and 'name' keys
          - Added error handling for missing spell names
          - Made spell name lookup more robust
        - Status: Fixed
     3. Operator Formatting Error: Spaces around operators in conditions
        - Root Cause: Condition conversion not preserving spaces around operators
        - Details:
          1. Generated code had conditions like "Player.SoulFragments>=4"
          2. Tests expected "Player.SoulFragments >= 4"
        - Fix Applied:
          - Modified _convert_condition method to properly handle spaces
          - Updated test assertions to expect spaces around operators
          - Improved code readability and Lua style consistency
        - Status: Fixed
   - Current Investigation: Complete
   - Fixes Applied:
     1. Updated _generate_spell_cast method in generator.py to be more flexible with spell name lookup
     2. Fixed condition formatting in Lua generator to preserve spaces around operators
     3. Updated test assertions to match Lua style conventions
